I have wanted to start a blog for many years but never got around to it. A big part of that, I think, is perfectionism. The fear of making a mistake, or someone reading my blog and thinking I am stupid, is preventing me from ever writing it in the first place even though the odds are no one will even read this. Years passed by with me doing nothing. I realized I will never be able to produce thoroughly researched, well-written posts that provide great value to the reader until I write many, many bad posts. Expect these posts to suck for a while, but one day I hope they will be great.
